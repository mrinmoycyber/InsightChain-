# InsightChain

**InsightChain** is an user-friendly research application that allows users to input URLs, extract data from those URLs, split the text into manageable chunks, create embeddings, and perform question-answering based on the extracted content. It utilizes the Langchain library to integrate OpenAI models and vector databases for effective data retrieval and processing.

## Features

- Input multiple URLs to extract text data.
- Split the extracted text into chunks for easier processing.
- Create embeddings using OpenAI models.
- Perform question-answering with sourced responses.
- Save and load embeddings using the FAISS vector store.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit
- Langchain
- OpenAI
- FAISS
- dotenv
